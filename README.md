# Generative AI Models Benchmark

This repository contains the winning project from the Kaggle AML 2024 Project 2 competition. The project involves a comparative analysis of generative AI models, starting with a benchmark comparison between a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This is followed by a performance comparison of a CDCGAN model with Diffusion models.
